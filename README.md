# Knora-gui

This is the home for the Knora team's user interface modules built for and with Angular.

## Developers note
We build the modules with [ng-packagr](https://github.com/dherges/ng-packagr) by following the [ng-packaged](https://github.com/dherges/ng-packaged)-example and this tutorial: https://medium.com/@nikolasleblanc/building-an-angular-4-component-library-with-the-angular-cli-and-ng-packagr-53b2ade0701e

This repository replaces the [salsah-modules](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/salsah-modules).
